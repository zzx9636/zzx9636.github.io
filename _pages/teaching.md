I am actively seeking GSI position at University of Michigan to support my graduate study. I have a lot of experience in serving large classes (300+ enrollment) and tutoring in various topics (undergraduate mechanical engineering classes, introductory control classes and introductory robotics classes).

## Fall 2015 - Spring 2018
Course Assistant, [*TAM 251*: Introductory Solid Mechanics](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/tam251/index.html), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

I have served as a course assistant in TAM 251 for three years. I have gained a lot of experiences in grading, leading classes, holding office hours, and coordinating instructors with students. Moreover, I have also contributed to improve the course setup based on an online problem-driven learning system [*PrairieLearn* ](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn) and participated in several research projects on teaching innovation led by [Prof. Mariana Silva](https://publish.illinois.edu/marianasilva/) and [Prof. Emma Mercier](https://www.emmamercier.com/).
