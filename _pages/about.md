My name is Zixu Zhang (pronunciation: *tzu-hsu chang*) and **张子煦** in Chinese. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton University advised by [Prof. Jaime Fernández Fisac](https://ee.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac). My research interest lies in mobile robot's perception, state estimation, and interaction with the real-world.

Recently, I have finished my Master from *Robotics Institute, University of Michigan*, where I worked with [Prof. Matthew Johnson-Roberson](https://droplab.engin.umich.edu/matthew-johnson-roberson) at [UM Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles](https://fcav.engin.umich.edu/). 

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from the *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign* (*UIUC*) in 2018, where I studied *Mechanical Engineering* and minored in both *Electrical Engineering* and *Computer Science*. During my undergraduate at UIUC, I have received great support and valuable advice from [Prof. Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/people/), [Prof. Leonardo Chamorro](http://chamorro.mechse.illinois.edu/index.htm), and [Prof. Ali Hamed](https://muse.union.edu/hameda/).
