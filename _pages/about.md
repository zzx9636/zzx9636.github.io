My name is Zixu Zhang (pronunciation: *tzu-hsu chang*) and **张子煦** in Chinese. Many people also call me Nick. I am currently a MS student at *Robotics Institute, University of Michigan*. 

My research interest lies in mobile robot's perception, understanding and interaction with the real-world environment. Recently, I have worked on active simultanous localization and mapping (*Active SLAM*) to improve the robustness of localization and navigation for ground robots.

Previously, I receieved my bachelor's degree from *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign* (*UIUC*), where I studied *Mechanical Engineering* and minored in both *Electrical Engineering* and *Computer Science*. During my undergaduate in UIUC, I have received great support and valuable advice from [Prof. Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/people/), [Prof. Leonardo Chamorro](http://chamorro.mechse.illinois.edu/index.htm), and [Prof. Ali Hamed](https://muse.union.edu/hameda/).
