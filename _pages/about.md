My name is Zixu Zhang (pronunciation: tzu-hsu chang) and 张子煦 in Chinese. Many people also call me Nick. I am currently a MS student at Robotics Institute, University of Michigan. 

My research interest lies in mobile robot's perception, understanding and interaction with the real-world environment. Recently, I have worked on several projects on active simultanous localization and mapping to improve the robustness of localization and navigation for ground robots.

Previously, I receieved my bachelor's degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I have received great support and valuable advice from [Prof. Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/people/), [Prof. Leonardo Chamorro](http://chamorro.mechse.illinois.edu/index.htm), and [Prof. Ali Hamed](https://muse.union.edu/hameda/).
